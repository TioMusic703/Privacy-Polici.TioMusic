### Information Collected

- **Server Information**: TioMusic may collect server-related data, such as server ID, channel ID, and user ID, solely for the purpose of providing music command functionality within the Discord server.
  
- **User Commands**: We log the commands entered by users, which helps us improve bot responsiveness and offer better music services.
  
- **Connection Data**: Basic connection logs may be collected for diagnostic purposes, such as timestamps, server load, and API request logs. However, we do not track or collect IP addresses or sensitive user information.
  
- **Diagnostic Data**: Error logs may be stored to help identify and resolve issues with the bot. This data is purely technical and anonymized.

### Data Use

- **Providing Services**: TioMusic uses the collected data to provide and optimize music services within the Discord server.

- **Service Improvements**: We analyze usage trends and anonymous data to enhance performance and add new features to improve the user experience.

- **Security Enhancements**: Server and user information are used to prevent abuse and ensure the bot functions within the scope of Discord’s terms and conditions.

### Data Sharing and Security

- **Third Party Services**: TioMusic does not share your information with third-party services. All data remains internal and is strictly used for service-related purposes.
  
- **Security Measures**: TioMusic implements security protocols to protect collected data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These include encrypted communications and limited access to data.

### User Controls and Choices

### Retention Period
